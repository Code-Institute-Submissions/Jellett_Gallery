            <div class="mt-3 text-black exhibition-paragraph">
                <p>In 1923, Mainie Jellett submitted a cubist piece, titled "Decoration" to the the annual Society of Dublin
                Painters' exhibition. It was an explosion of overlapping color fields, with a religious icon as centre-piece.
                It was modern, strident, and loudly cubist. In the firestorm that followed the reviewer for The Irish Times was
                baffled, writing the work was nonsense “it might, to the man who understands the most up-to-date
                modern art, mean something; but to me it presents an insoluble mess.” Prominent art critic George Russell
                called Jellett “a late victim to Cubism in some sub-section of this artistic malaria.”</p>

            <div class="mt-1 text-black exhibition-paragraph">
                <p>She had touched a nerve but this piece would go on to hold place of honor at the National Gallery.
                Critical reversal was swift as in only four years the Irish Times heralded Jellett as “the only serious
                exponent in this country of the ultra-modernist school of painting.” For the next two 
                decades, Jellett created work that would define art in Ireland. Her pieces would represent the nation at
                the Olympic Games.</p>

                <p>Jellett co-founded the Irish Exhibition of Living Art, a celebration of unconventional Irish artists. She wrote in
                "An Approach To Paining", about her desire to represent the spirit of her country and its people:</p>

               <div class="mt-3 mb-5 text-black exhibition-paragraph">
                <p> “The idea of an artist being a special person, an exotic flower set apart from other people is one of the errors resulting
                from the industrial revolution, and the fact of artists being pushed out of their lawful position in the life and society
                of the present day. … Their present enforced isolation from the majority is a very serious situation and I believe it is 
                one of the many causes which has resulted in the present chaos we live in. The art of a nation is one of the ultimate facts
                by which its spiritual health is judged and appraised by posterity.”</p>

                    <p> The Jellett Gallery is a space dedicated to supporting young female artists.
                        We are a commercial gallery run operated as collective by the artists themselves. 
                        When an objective critique was applied to the art world clear systematic discrimintaion
                        was present. The experiences of Mainie Jellett deeply informed the creation of this collective, 
                        the individual discrimination she faced would be challenged by collective struggle.</p>

                        <p> The gallery does not, however, supporting any particular ideology or
                        arts practice. It is a space which sought and found a place within Ireland’s 
                        vibrant art culture to represent female artists. We make no apologies, give no critiques,
                        write no thesis, the work will have to speak for itself. Member selection, exhibition curation and hanging,
                        invitations and openings are undertaken by the collective committee. </p>
