Currently her work in progress is focused on the human brain. Walshe’s paintings give room for speculation as the forms correlate between presence and absence, aliveness and decay.\r\n\r\nShe sees the inner workings of land and body as an interconnected universe. They are offered up like a gift or a sacrifice. Drawing upon a mix of influences such as abstract expressionism, bog-bodies and the aesthetics of museum display, her works harbour traditional categorizations of life and death and formal renderings of objects, yet they have a contemporary sensibility. Her paintings are both unsettling and compelling.\r\n\r\nChanelle Walshe graduated from The National College of Art and Design, Dublin, Ireland in 2010. Recent exhibitions include Beatland, Pallas Projects, Dublin 2017 (solo), Nerve and Sinew, Custom House Gallery, Westport 2017 (2 person), A Knowing Nature, The Dock, Carrick-on-Shannon 2016, Panorama, curated by Kathy Tynan and Chanelle Walshe, Pallas Projects, Dublin, 2015 and Not Life Necessarily, NCAD Gallery, Dublin, 2014 (2 person). Walshe is a recipient of The Thomas Dammann Award 2015 and completed a studio residency at The Royal Hibernian Academy, Dublin in 2015.", "image_url": null, "image": "Chanelle_walshe_herself_9dLKGUa.jpg"}}, {"model": "products.category", "pk": 4, "fields": {"name": "chloe_early", "friendly_name": "Chloe Early", "description": "", "image_url": null, "image": "ChloeEarlyPortrait_NMY98IH.jpg"}}, {"model": "products.category", "pk": 5, "fields": {"name": "eileen_o'sullivan", "friendly_name": "Eileen O'Sullivan", "description": "", "image_url": null, "image": "EileenPotrait_SxX5zXY.jpg"}}, {"model": "products.category", "pk": 6, "fields": {"name": "emma_sheridan", "friendly_name": "Emma Sheridan", "description": "", "image_url": null, "image": "Emma_Sheridan_herself_BLZatxX.jpg"}}, {"model": "products.category", "pk": 7, "fields": {"name": "jane_rainey", "friendly_name": "Jane Rainey", "description": "", "image_url": null, "image": "janeRainey_2STx4jl.jpg"}}, {"model": "products.category", "pk": 8, "fields": {"name": "leah_beggs", "friendly_name": "Leah Beggs", "description": "", "image_url": null, "image": "LeahBeggsPortrait_0sFO0M7.jpg"}}, {"model": "products.category", "pk": 9, "fields": {"name": "lola_donoghue", "friendly_name": "Lola Donoghue", "description": "", "image_url": null, "image": "Herself_kYe7ekZ.jpg"}}]
