Her subjects would be comic, were they not painted with such seriousness and such careful study…… Douthit’s wonderful little canvases ask us simply to look at them.  (The Irish Arts Review, Winter, 2014)\r\n\r\nAlthough technically more challenging, Douthit likes to work wet on wet, enjoying the fluidity of the process. Historically, she places her work in the tradition of 18th century still life painters such as Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin and his depictions of everyday objects. She is also drawn to the even-toned understatement found in the work of Giorgio Morandi and Gwen John “These painters allow paint to speak for itself, for the subject and for a moment in time,” she says. “With their own language, they each extend something beyond the surface of a painting.”\r\n\r\nBorn in the US, Douthit studied at the University of North Dakota and at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. She completed her MFA at the Burren College of Art in 2014.

She later moved to Ireland with her family, where she spent her teens drawing, writing and absorbing influences, which range from the Southern Gothic to the cartoons of Robert Crumb; from Nineteenth Century Russian literature to American motel culture and the Delta blues. The result is a style distinctly her own – unsettling, direct and quietly humorous. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, she added Los Angeles as a second home. Teaming up with friend and photographer Alex Prager, Mercedes Helnwein began exhibiting her art regularly around L.A. in unorthodox one-night shows. Her intricate pencil drawings of weird goings-on soon began to attract a strong following, making her a vital presence the L.A. art scene. She followed these shows with solo outings in Berlin, London and twice at The Molesworth Gallery in Dublin. Mercedes Helnwein currently divides her time between downtown Los Angeles and Ireland. Her work is in many important international collections, while her most recent exhibition in London was bought out in its entirety by Damien Hirst, who is amassing one of the UK's most important collections of contemporary art.", "image_url": null, "image": "mercedes_helnwein_herself_wHXBRec.jpg"}}, {"model": "products.category", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "chanelle_walshe", "friendly_name": "Chanelle Walshe", "description": "Chanelle Walshe’s paintings reflect her interest in organs, flesh, soil, divine intelligence and the healing process.

Walshe’s paintings give room for speculation as the forms correlate between presence and absence, aliveness and decay.\r\n\r\nShe sees the inner workings of land and body as an interconnected universe. They are offered up like a gift or a sacrifice. Drawing upon a mix of influences such as abstract expressionism, bog-bodies and the aesthetics of museum display, her works harbour traditional categorizations of life and death and formal renderings of objects, yet they have a contemporary sensibility. Her paintings are both unsettling and compelling.\r\n\r\nChanelle Walshe graduated from The National College of Art and Design, Dublin, Ireland in 2010.

The tropes draw from historical work plays a clear role in her series \"Suspended,\" partly inspired by Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s sculpture, The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa.\r\n\r\n“I’ve always been interested in opposites in my work and exploring themes which can have a dual interpretation,” Early has said. She paints bodies among clusters of images such as planes, birds, and carnival rides, yet the representational elements of her paintings dissolve into painterly swaths of colours, dripped and scraped across the compositions. Each painting, often comprised of oil on aluminum, offers a lush and luminous play with light. \r\n\r\nThe music video for the song Iris (Hold Me Close) by U2 exhibits a coming of age story by Early.

O’Sullivan said that she began work for this exhibition with “The idea that each painting had to have a table in it to find a level of comfort and togetherness”.
